This app works by typing in one of four commands (concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this, and do-what-it-says) when a user types in one of these four things into NodeJS, Node will asynchronously search for a set of given parameters, and return data based on what you searched. Above is a working example of what the LIRI node app can do.
